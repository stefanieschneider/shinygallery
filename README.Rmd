## Overview

This R package creates image gallery widgets with pagination to show images based on file or URL paths. shinygallery is built on top of [jPages](https://github.com/luis-almeida/jPages) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

If `limits` is set in `options`, only images within the specified interval are rendered. This allows, e.g., to display further images only after a page change; the loading speed is thus improved.

## Installation

You can install the development version of shinygallery from [GitHub](https://github.com/stefanieschneider/shinygallery):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stefanieschneider/shinygallery")
```

## Usage

```{r example, code = readLines("inst/examples/gallery.R")}
```
